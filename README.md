# How It's Made:
Tech Used: R, RStudio, GoogleVis, Janitor, Tidyr, dplyr.

Data Cleaning and Pre-processing: Leveraging R packages like Janitor, Tidyr, and dplyr, the dataset underwent cleaning and pre-processing, enabling a more accurate analysis.

Visualization: The GoogleVis package in R facilitated the depiction of flow and drop-offs at each stage of the application process. 

Tracking System: A comprehensive tracking system was established for OnePointFive to monitor consumersâ€™ progress right from early interactions to eventual enrollments. From exporting the AirTable and Hubspot data, to cleaning it, the goal was to structure future Cohort analyses and produce relevant insights.

# Strategic Insights:
This analysis was pivotal in discerning significant drop points in the consumer journey, and allowed OnePointFive to make data-driven decisions to enhance customer retention. 

Insights from the analysis prompted strategic modifications such as:

Enhancing Timelines: The interval between the interview and acceptance stages was expedited to maintain consumer interest.

Innovative Marketing Strategies: Inspired by Duolingo, memorable enrollment strategies and incentives were devised to motivate users to join the academy.

Extending Interview Timeframes: 15-minute interviews were changed to 20-minutes to increase client engagement and pitch the academy.

# Lessons Learned:
Learning to adapt and employ innovative marketing strategies to enhance user enrollment was instrumental in shaping a more user-centric and efficient application process. This ultimately contributed to the enhanced success of OnePointFive Academy.
